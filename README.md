# Text-to-Image Generation with DCGAN on CUB Dataset

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for text-to-image synthesis, trained on the CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds) dataset. The work was developed for Seminar 2 at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.

## Project Contents

- Project Code: The implementation of the DCGAN model for text-to-image generation.

- Seminar Paper: A detailed report describing the methodology, experiments, and results.

- Training Graphs: Visualizations of training progress and performance metrics.

- Output Images: Samples of generated images produced by the model.


## Dataset

- The model is trained on the [CUB-200-2011](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/) dataset, which contains bird images paired with corresponding textual descriptions.
